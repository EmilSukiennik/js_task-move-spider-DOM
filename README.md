A small interactive JavaScript project where a spider moves to the cursor position when the user clicks. The spider's center aligns precisely with the pointer, while smart boundary logic ensures it never crosses the wall edges. Basic CSS styles define the wall and spider appearance for smooth visual feedback. Project completed as a part of my front-end web development course.
